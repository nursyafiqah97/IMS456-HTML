	<h1>Experience MCO during period to day</h1>
</b>
	<p>Movement Control Order (MCO) in Malaysia have been 
	implemented on March 18, 2020 until today. There are 
	three phases for MCO to control the outbreak of covid-19 
	disease. For the first phase was started from 18 to 
	March 31, 2020 and followed by the second phase from 1 
	to April 14, 2020 while the third phase runs from 15 to 
	April 28, 2020 and it tooks for 2 weeks by each phase. 
	During this MCO, I've gained a lot of experience such as:
	</p>

<ol>
	<li>I learned to control movement boundaries.</li>
	<li>I have to take a distance myself for one meter from 
the crowd.</li>
	<li>I always wash my hands in the right way by using 
water and soap or hand sanitizer.</li>
	<li>I must to wearing a masks and gloves when going out 
from the house.</li>
	<li>I learned that only family heads allowed to go out 
to buy daily necessities from 8am until 8pm.</li>
	<li>I always to take good care of my health to avoid 
from be exposed to this outbreak</li>
</ol>

	<p>At the time of the MCO, I was already at the family
	residential. To prevent this covid-19 outbreak, I took 
	steps to stay at home and spend time with my family. I 
	am so grateful that I was able to spend time with them 
	by doing various activities to fulfilled my leisure time 
	before the online classes begin. There are several 
	activities that I did during MCO with my family 
	which is:
	
<ol>
	<li>Make an exercise at home in the morning together.</li
>
	<li>Helping each others by cleaning the house and doing
other activities</li>
	<li>Learned to cooking the various food with my mother.
</li>
	<li>Learned and try to making an ice cream with my

	<p>Starting this week, Sunday through Thursday, Online 
	Distance Learning (ODL) is started. So I have to pay 
	attention to my classes and online lessons. In Online 
	Distance Learning, I use several mediums to communicate 
	with my lectures and classmates. This is what I am doing 
	for my studies and the medium that I used is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I make and submit an assignment.</li>
	<li>I make a video of presentation.</li>
	<li>I do an exercises for test and quizzes.</li>
	<li>I takes a time to read a textbook.</li>

<p>So throughout this MCO period there was a lot of experience 
that I gained and learned about this case. I would like to 
thank the frontliners team for working hard to resolve the 
outbreak. We must follow and obey the instructions of the 
Ministry of Health (MOH) and prime minister. Take note of what 
has happened and there is definitely wisdom behind it.</p>
